      This is done with the target attribute.
      The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document and it can have one of the following values:
      <!-- _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
      _self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
      _parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
      _top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
      framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame -->

      The paragraph is a block-level element.
    </p>
    <p>
      A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and
      right as far as it can).
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of block-level elements:
        div
        h1 - h6
        p
        form
    </p>
    <p>This <span>span</span> is an inline element</p>
    <p>
      This
      <span>
        An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element.
        Generally, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements.
        The following example demonstrates the inline element's influence:
      </span>
      is an inline element
    </p>
    
    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
      <h2>Lisbon</h2>
      <p>Div Element
         The div element belongs to the block-level group, often used as a container for other HTML elements.
         The div element has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.
         When used together with CSS, the div element can be used to style blocks of content,
         as we can see in the example below:
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>My super
      <span style="color:red">Span Element
          The span element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything.
          It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes),
          or because they share attribute values, such as lang.
          The span is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline element.
        </span>
        Heading
    </h1>
    <p>
      Classes using the html class attribute makes it possible to define equal styles, for elements with the same class name.
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
          <style>
            div.cities {
              background-color: black;
              color: white;
              margin: 20px 0 20px 0;
              padding: 20px;
            }
          </style>
        </pre>

      <p>Kingston is the capital city of Jamaica.</p>

    <p>This is some random but <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>
    <button type="button">The button tag defines a clickable button.</button>
    <p>
      These buttons work and behave in exactly the same way as our counterparts above.
      In addition to submitting the form, you can make them disabled, add an accesskey or even specify a tabindex.
